Steps for Elevator Sizing:
-1  load optimized_vehicle
-2  create aircraft with any elevator 
-3  run 1st mission: Pull up
-4  run 2nd mission: Push over
-5  Store results and properties (Forces, Moments, Drag)
-6  Manually change elevator size (keep chord same, vary length)
-7  Repeat from step 3
-8  Manually change elevator size (keep chord same, vary length)
-9  Repeat again from step 3
-10 Get relation between derivative and control surface area
-11 Solve the Longitudinal equations to trim the aircraft
