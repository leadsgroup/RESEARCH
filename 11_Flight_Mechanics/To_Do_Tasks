Matthew's to do tasks:
--------------------------
Code up moment of intertia for wing - Done(?)
Intergrate moment of inertia calculations into code - Done(?)
check to see if control surfaces are connected to the mission
Figure out a way to mission witn n-dimensional surrogate i.e.  CL vs AoA, Mach, elevator deflection  - Done(?)
Set up pertubation problems 

==========================
Matteo's to do tasks:
--------------------------
Analytical computation of latero-directional stability coefficients  - Done(?)
VLM code modification 
Modeling latero-directional stability derivatives
Testing and validation
Nice-to-have: dynamic latero-directional stability

To-do list for stability paper:

- Building blocks:
        - Change Stability derives to direct VLM call with no surrogate model
        - Confirm accuracy of stability derivatives
        - Confirm curved flight segment works - Aidan
        - Confirm MOI RCAIDE estimate works for Navion - Aidan

- Aircraft:
        - Finish eSTOL - Aidan
        - Fix Navion model - Aidan
        - Add control surfaces to stopped rotor
        - Add control surfaces to tilt stopped rotor
        - Add control surfaces to tilt rotor

- Mission:
        - Create standardized mission
        - Verify mission runs

- General:
        - Create script outline for one aircraft and mission
        - Create automated script to run all cases

- Post-run:
        - Check if results make physical sense.
